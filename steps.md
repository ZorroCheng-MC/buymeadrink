Step 1: 
Extract drink menu
Prompt: "I have a PDF menu for a Taiwanese bubble tea shop. Can you extract a list of drinks in Chinese with their prices in a table format?"

Step 2: 
Create a simple HTML form artifact. 
Prompt: "Using the drink list you extracted, create a simple HTML form artifact for ordering bubble tea. Include fields for name, drink selection, size, ice level, and sugar level."

Step 3: 
Enhance the form
Prompt: "Enhance the HTML form by adding 
1. a live-updating table of orders
2. a chart showing drink popularity 
3. a countdown timer stop at 1pm today for a limited-time offer.
4. a total counter with cost dashboard.

Step 4: Convert to React with backend
Prompt: "I want multiple users to be able to input orders simultaneously. Can you convert this to a React app with a simple backend? Please provide local installation steps and testing procedures after running 'npm start'."

Step 5: Deploy online
Prompt: "I want to deploy this app online so anyone can access and update the form through their browser. Can you provide steps to deploy this React app and its backend using Vercel?"

Demo Script:

1. Start by showing the PDF menu and use the first prompt to get a list of drinks in Chinese with prices.

2. Use the second prompt to quickly create a basic HTML form for ordering.

3. Demonstrate how easy it is to add advanced features using the third prompt.

4. Explain the need for real-time updates and use the fourth prompt to get a React version with a backend.

5. Finally, use the fifth prompt to get deployment instructions for making the app globally accessible.

This approach simplifies the process into five clear steps, each initiated by a single prompt. It demonstrates how AI can rapidly prototype and develop a full-stack application, from concept to deployment, with minimal technical input from the user.
